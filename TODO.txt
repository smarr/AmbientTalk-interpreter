* Refactor Base interfaces into base_ methods.

- Reflection
* Review and fix mirrors and mirages (add/remove "base" and "meta" prefix)

* variable parameters and arguments
* remove as much .asNative...() casts from the code

- Documentation
* Package structure
* Class and interface hierarchy: NAT, AT, AG, X => structure and purpose

* asXXX and isXXX protocol / deny direct downcasts + NATObject.cast
* asNativeXXX and javaValues
* NATNil's meta_invoke method
* Mirrors and Mirages: lots of drawings!

* Exceptions: raise method / deny direct throwing of exceptions
* Evaluator: meta_eval and meta_quote/unquote

* MTH hierarchy?
