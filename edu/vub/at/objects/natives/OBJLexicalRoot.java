 * An instance of the class OBJLexicalRoot represents the lexical root of an actor.
 * Since a lexical root is sealed (it cannot be modified) and contains no mutable fields,
 * it should be possible to share a singleton instance of this class among all actors.
 * 
 * The lexical root is an object containing globally visible AmbientTalk native methods.
 * Such methods include control structures such as if:then:else: and while:do:
 * but also object creation methods like object: and extend:with:
 * 
 * OBJLexicalRoot extends NATNil such that it inherits that class's ATObject protocol
 * to convert AmbientTalk invocations of a method m into Java meta_m invocations.
